# `html`: JSX-Like Syntax for Tagged Template Literals

You can find my writeup of what this is used for in [my original blog on the matter](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2019/jsx-like-syntax-for-tagged-template-literals/).

## Usage

Copy/paste the contents of `html.js` into your own codebase.

Or, install it in your project (this isn't published on NPM, but you _can_ install directly from GitHub or pull it in from a service like jsdeliver):

- Node: `npm i jimniels/html`
- Browser: `import html from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jimniels/html@0.2.0/html.js"`
